# Popup

### Options / New Changes

Will open the [Options](/elements/options/) page, landing on the **Changelog**.

### Docs

Links you to âœ¨**this docs site**âœ¨.

### Domain URL

*If you don't use Github enterprise, don't worry about this - as all links default to `github.com`.*

Basically I use this for the prefix for all links on the popup, in order to link you to the correct repos/global pages. So if you use a Github Enterprise domain regularly, your links in this popup to each repo will still work ðŸŽ‰.



### Global filters

The following will appear if you have global filters saved for either of these pages.
The links are here to make accessing these pages easier.

- Global Pulls
- Global Issues

### Repos that have saved filters

The following will appear if you have repo specific filters saved.
The links are here to make accessing these filters for each repo easier.
