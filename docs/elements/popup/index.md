# Popup

By pinning the **Github Saved Filters** extension to your extensions bar, you unlock this handy little popup, of which grants you a few nifty shortcuts to take advantage of.

<GsfPopup/>

## Filter links

### Global filters

:::: flex
<div>
The following will appear if you have global filters saved for either of these pages.
The links are here to make accessing these pages easier.

- [Global pulls](https://github.com/pulls)
- [Global issues](https://github.com/issues)
</div>

## Docs

Links you to ‚ú®**this docs site**‚ú®.

## Domain URL

:::: flex
<div>

*If you don't use Github enterprise, don't worry about this - as all links default to `github.com`.*

Basically I use this for the prefix for all links on the popup, in order to link you to the correct repos/global pages. So if you use a Github Enterprise domain regularly, your links in this popup to each repo will still work üéâ.

## Donate a coffee

:::: flex
Links you to my [kofi](https://ko-fi.com/auroraskye) donation page.<br/>
*All donations are very welcomed and hugely appreciated* ‚ù§Ô∏èÔ∏è
