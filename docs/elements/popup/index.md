## Domain URL

:::: flex
<div>

*If you don't use Github enterprise, don't worry about this - as all links default to `github.com`.*

Basically I use this for the prefix for all links on the popup, in order to link you to the correct repos/global pages. So if you use a Github Enterprise domain regularly, your links in this popup to each repo will still work ðŸŽ‰.
</div>
